**Step 3: Create your account with edX**

Fill out the form in the pop-up window: (Some tips: Â Use an email address you check regularly. Also, the username you choose will also be your screen name in the course. This means the only name we will know you by is the username (not a first and last name). Please include your last name as part of your username so we can tell who you are on the forums.)


**Step 4: Activate your edX account**

Check your email. This is where your course activation link has been sent. You must click on this to finalize your access to the course.

Congratulations! You should now have an edX account and be registered for [ENTER YOUR COURSE NUMBER].

Proceed with Step 5 to access the class materials.


**Step 5: Log in to edX and go the course website**

Log in to your account on edX at https://edge.edx.org/
by using the username and password you just created.
You will be taken to the main landing page of your edX edge account, which should now include a listing for [ENTER YOUR COURSE NUMBER]: [REPLACE WITH SCREENSHOT OF YOUR COURSE]

You can now click **View Courseware** to enter the main course website.
