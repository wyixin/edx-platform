* :ref:`General`
* :ref:`Checkbox Problem XML`
* :ref:`Chemical Equation Problem XML`
* :ref:`Drag and Drop Problem XML`
* :ref:`Dropdown Problem XML`
* :ref:`Image Mapped Input Problem XML`

.. _General:

=======
General
=======
 
Most problems have the following tags.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``<problem> </problem>``
     - These must be the first and last tags for any content created in the Advanced Editor in a Problem component.
   * - ``<startouttext/>``
     - The ``<startouttext />`` tag indicates the beginning of a line or block of text.
   * - ``<endouttext/>``
     - The ``<endouttext />`` tag indicates the end of a line or block of text.
   * - ``<solution> <div class="detailed-solution"> </div> </solution>`` (optional)
     - If you want to include more information in the problem, such as a detailed explanation of the problem's answer, you'll enter the text between the two ``<div>`` tags, which are inside the ``<solution>`` tags. (These tags do not have to be on the same line.)

Additionally, all problems must include a **label** attribute. This attribute adds a descriptive label that helps visually impaired students navigate through the problem.

You'll add a **label** attribute to one of the XML tags for the problem. Each example problem below includes a label.

.. _Checkbox Problem XML:

* ``<draggable/>``: Specifies a single object that a student will drag onto the base image.
* ``<target>``: Specifies the location on the base image where a draggable must be dropped.

**Tag:** ``<drag_and_drop_input/>``

  Attributes

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - img (required)
       - Relative path to an image that will be the base image. All draggables can be dragged onto it.
     * - target_outline 
       - Specifies whether an outline (gray dashed line) should be drawn around targets (if they are specified). It can be either 'true' or 'false'. If not specified, the targets do not have outlines.
     * - one_per_target 
       - Specify whether to allow more than one draggable to be placed onto a single target. It can be either 'true' or 'false'. If not specified, the default value is 'true'.
     * - no_labels (required)
       - default is false, in default behaviour if label is not set, label is obtained from id. If no_labels is true, labels are not automatically populated from id, and one can not set labels and obtain only icons.

  Children

     * ``<draggable>``
     * ``<target>``

**Tag:** ``<draggable/>``

Specifies a single draggable object in a drag and drop problem.

A draggable is what the user must drag out of the slider and drop onto the base image. After a drag operation, if the center of the draggable is located outside the rectangular dimensions of the image, it will be returned to the slider.

For the grader to work, each draggable must have a unique ID.

  Attributes

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - id (required)
       - Unique identifier of the draggable object.
     * - label (optional)
       - Text label that the user sees.
     * - icon (optional)
       - For draggables that are images, the relative path to the image file.
     * - can_reuse
       - true or false, default is false. If true, same draggable can be used multiple times.

  Children
  
  (none)

**Tag:** ``<target>``

Specifies the location on the base image where a student must drop a draggable item. By design, if the center of a draggable lies within the target (i.e. in the rectangle defined by [[x, y], [x + w, y + h]],  it is within the target. Otherwise, it is outside.

If you specify at least one target, and a student drops a draggable item on a location that is outside a target, the draggable item returns to the slider.

If you don't specify a target, a student can drop a draggable item anywhere on the base image.

  Attributes

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - id (required)

.. _JS Input Problem XML:

=============================
JavaScript Input Problem XML 
=============================

JSInput allows problem authors to turn stand-alone HTML files into problems that can be integrated into the edX platform. Since its aim is flexibility, it can be seen as the input and client-side equivalent of **CustomResponse**.

A JSInput exercise creates an IFrame in a static HTML page, and passes the return value of author-specified functions to the enclosing response type (generally **CustomResponse**). JSInput can also store and retrieve state.

Template
--------

The following is the basic format of a JSInput problem:

.. code-block:: xml

 <problem>
        <script type="loncapa/python">
 def all_true(exp, ans): return ans == "hi"
        </script>
        <customresponse cfn="all_true">
            <jsinput gradefn="gradefn" 
                height="500"
                get_statefn="getstate"
                set_statefn="setstate"
                html_file="/static/jsinput.html"/>
        </customresponse>
 </problem>

The accepted attributes are:

==============  ==============  =========  ==========
Attribute Name   Value Type     Required   Default
==============  ==============  =========  ==========
html_file        URL string     Yes        None
gradefn          Function name  Yes        `gradefn`
set_statefn      Function name  No         None
get_statefn      Function name  No         None
height           Integer        No         `500`
width            Integer        No         `400`
==============  ==============  =========  ==========


Required Attributes
-------------------

* **html_file**

  The **html_file** attribute specifies the HTML file that the IFrame will point to. The HTML file
  must be located in the content directory.

  The IFrame is created using the sandbox attribute. Although pop-ups, scripts, and pointer locks are allowed, the IFrame cannot access its parent's attributes.

  The HTML file must contain a **gradefn** function that the JSInput file can access. To determine whether the **gradefn** function is accessible, in the console, make sure that **gradefn** returns the right thing. When JSInput uses the **gradefn** function, `gradefn` is called with `gradefn`.call(`obj`), where **obj** is the object-part of **gradefn**. For example, if **gradefn** is **myprog.myfn**, JSInput calls **myprog.myfun.call(myprog)**. (This is to ensure "`this`" continues to refer to what `gradefn` expects.)

  Aside from that, more or less anything goes. Note that currently there is no support for inheriting CSS or JavaScript from the parent (aside from the Chrome-only **seamless** attribute, which is set to True by default).

* **gradefn**

  The **gradefn** attribute specifies the name of the function that will be called when a user clicks **Check**, and that returns the student's answer. Unless both the **get_statefn** and **set_statefn** attributes are also used, this answer is passed as a string to the enclosing response type. In the **customresponse** example above, this means **cfn** will be passed this answer as ``ans``.

  If the **gradefn** function throws an exception when a student attempts to submit a problem, the submission is aborted, and the student receives a generic alert. The alert can be customised by making the exception name ``Waitfor Exception``; in that case, the alert message will be the exception message.

  .. important:: To make sure the student's latest answer is passed correctly, make sure that the **gradefn** function is not asynchronous. Additionally, make sure that the function returns promptly. Currently the student has no indication that her answer is being calculated or produced.

Optional Attributes
-------------------

* **set_statefn**

  Sometimes a problem author will want information about a student's previous answers ("state") to be saved and reloaded. If the attribute **set_statefn** is used, the function given as its value will be passed the state as a string argument whenever there is a state, and the student returns to a problem. The function has the responsibility to then use this state approriately.

  The state that is passed is:

  * The previous output of **gradefn** (i.e., the previous answer) if **get_statefn** is not defined.
  * The previous output of **get_statefn** (see below) otherwise.

  It is the responsibility of the iframe to do proper verification of the argument that it receives via **set_statefn**.

* **get_statefn**

  Sometimes the state and the answer are quite different. For instance, a problem that involves using a javascript program that allows the student to alter a molecule may grade based on the molecule's hydrophobicity, but from the hydrophobicity it might be incapable of restoring the state. In that case, a
  *separate* state may be stored and loaded by **set_statefn**. Note that if **get_statefn** is defined, the answer (i.e., what is passed to the enclosing response type) will be a json string with the following format:

  .. code-block:: xml

      {
          answer: `[answer string]`
          state: `[state string]`
      }


  The enclosing response type must then parse this as json.

* **height** and **width**

  The **height** and **width** attributes are straightforward: they specify the height and width of the IFrame. Both are limited by the enclosing DOM elements, so for instance there is an implicit max-width of around 900. 

  In the future, JSInput may attempt to make these dimensions match the HTML file's dimensions (up to the aforementioned limits), but currently it defaults to `500` and `400` for **height** and **width**, respectively.

* ``<responseparam>`` (optional): Specifies a tolerance, or margin of error, for an answer.
* ``<script>`` (optional):

.. note:: Some older problems use the ``<textline math="1" />`` tag instead of the ``<formulaequationinput />`` tag. However, the ``<textline math="1" />`` tag has been deprecated. All new problems should use the ``<formulaequationinput />`` tag.

**Tag:** ``<numericalresponse>``

Specifies that the problem is a numerical input problem. The ``<numericalresponse>`` tag is similar to the ``<formularesponse>`` tag, but the ``<numericalresponse>`` tag does not allow unspecified variables.

     * - answer (required)
       - The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical expression. 

  .. note:: If you include a variable name preceded with a dollar sign ($) in the problem, you can include a script in the problem that computes the expression in terms of that variable.

  The grader evaluates the answer that you provide and the student's response in the same way. The grader also automatically simplifies any numeric expressions that you or a student provides. Answers can include simple expressions such as "0.3" and "42", or more complex expressions such as "1/3" and "sin(pi/5)".

**Tag:** ``<script>``

Specifies a script that the grader uses to evaluate a student's response. A problem behaves as if all of the code in all of the script tags were in a single script tag. Specifically, any variables that are used in multiple ``<script>`` tags share a namespace and can be overriden.

As with all Python, indentation matters, even though the code is embedded in XML.

* ``<formularesponse>``

* ``<script>``

**Tag:** ``<formularesponse>``

Specifies that the problem is a math expression input problem. The ``<formularesponse>`` tag is similar to ``<numericalresponse>``, but ``<formularesponse>`` allows unknown variables.

  Attributes

  **type**: Can be "cs" (case sensitive, the default) or "ci" (case insensitive, so that capitalization doesn't matter in variable names).

  **answer**: The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical expression. If you precede a variable name in the problem with a dollar sign ($), you can include a script in the problem that computes the expression in terms of that variable.

  **samples**: Specifies important information about the problem in four lists:

    * **variables**: A set of variables that students can enter.
    * **lower_bounds**: For every defined variable, a lower bound on the numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * **upper_bounds**: For every defined variable, an upper bound on the numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * **num_samples**: The number of times to test the expression.

    Commas separate items inside each of the four individual lists, and the at sign (@), colon (:), and pound sign (#) characters separate the four lists. The format is the following:

    ``"variables@lower_bounds:upper_bounds#num_samples``

    For example, a ``<formularesponse>`` tag that includes the **samples** attribute may look like either of the following.

    ``<formularesponse samples="x,n@1,2:3,4#10">``

    ``<formularesponse samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10">``

  Children

  * ``<formulaequationinput />``

**Tag:** ``<formulaequationinput />``

Creates a response field where a student types an answer to the problem in plain text, as well as a second field below the response field where the student sees a typeset version of the plain text. The parser that renders the student's plain text into typeset math is the same parser that evaluates the student's response for grading.

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - default (required)
       - A number or a percentage specifying how close the student and grader expressions must be. Failure to include a tolerance leaves expressions vulnerable to unavoidable rounding errors during sapling, causing some student input to be graded as incorrect, even if it is algebraically equivalent to the grader's expression.

       - "tolerance"--defines a tolerance for a number

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - answer (required)
       - Specifies the correct answer. To designate the answer as a regular expression, add "regexp" to the **type** attribute. If you do not add "regexp" to the **type** attribute, the student's answer must match the value in this attribute exactly.
     * - type (optional)
       - Can specify whether the problem is case sensitive and allows regular expressions. If the ``<stringresponse>`` tag includes ``type="ci"``, the problem is not case sensitive. If the tag includes ``type="cs"``, the problem is case sensitive. If the tag includes ``type="regexp"``, the problem allows regular expressions. A **type** attribute in a ``<stringresponse>`` tag can also combine these values. For example, ``<stringresponse type="regexp cs">`` specifies that the prolem allows regular expressions and is case sensitive.
