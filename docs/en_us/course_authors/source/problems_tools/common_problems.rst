Common Problems
###############

*Common problems* are typical problems such as multiple choice problems and other problems whose answers are simple for students to select or enter. You can create all of these problems using the Simple Editor in Studio. You don't have to use XML or switch to the Advanced Editor. (However, this section also provides sample XML code for these problems in the Advanced Editor.)

The following are the common problem types in Studio:

-  :ref:`Checkbox` In checkbox problems, students select one or more options
   from a list of possible answers.
-  :ref:`Dropdown` In dropdown problems, students select one answer from a
   dropdown list.
-  :ref:`Multiple Choice` Multiple choice problems require students to
   select one answer from a list of choices that appear directly below
   the question.
-  :ref:`Numerical Input` Numerical input problems require answers that
   include only integers, fractions, and a few common constants and
   operators.
-  :ref:`Text Input` In text input problems, students enter a short text
   answer to a question.

These problems are easy to access in Studio. To create them, click
**Problem** under **Add New Component**, click the **Common Problem
Types** tab, and then click the name of the problem. 

.. note:: All problems must include labels for accessibility. The label generally includes the text of the main question in your problem. To add a label for a common problem, surround the text of the label with angle brackets pointed toward the text (>>*label text*<<).

.. _Checkbox:

*******************
Checkbox
*******************

In checkbox problems, the student selects one or more options from a
list of possible answers. The student must select all the options that
apply to answer the problem correctly. Each checkbox problem must have
at least one correct answer.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click **Problem**.
#. In the **Select Problem Component Type** screen, click **Checkboxes** on the **Common Problem Types** tab.
#. In the Problem component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. In the component editor, replace the default text with the text of your 
   problem. Enter each answer option on its own line.
#. Determine the text of the problem to use as a label, and then surround that text with two sets of angle brackets (>><<).
#. Select all the answer options, and then click the checkbox button. 

   .. image:: ../Images/ProbComponent_CheckboxIcon.gif

For the example problem above, the text in the Problem component is the
following.

.. code-block:: xml

    Learning about the benefits of preventative healthcare can be particularly 
    difficult. >>Check all of the reasons below why this may be the case.<<

    [x] A large amount of time passes between undertaking a preventative measure and seeing the result. 
    [ ] Non-immunized people will always fall sick. 
    [x] If others are immunized, fewer people will fall sick regardless of a particular individual's choice to get immunized or not. 
    [x] Trust in healthcare professionals and government officials is fragile. 

    [explanation]
    People who are not immunized against a disease may still not fall sick from the disease. If someone is trying to learn whether or not preventative measures against the disease have any impact, he or she may see these people and conclude, since they have remained healthy despite not being immunized, that immunizations have no effect. Consequently, he or she would tend to believe that immunization 
    (or other preventative measures) have fewer benefits than they actually do.

*******************
Dropdown
*******************

Dropdown problems allow the student to choose from a collection of
answer options, presented as a dropdown list. Unlike multiple choice
problems, whose answers are always visible directly below the question,
dropdown problems don't show answer choices until the student clicks
the dropdown arrow.

    >>Lateral inhibition, as was first discovered in the horsehoe crab:<<

    ( ) is a property of touch sensation, referring to the ability of crabs to 
    detect nearby predators.
    ( ) is a property of hearing, referring to the ability of crabs to detect 
    low frequency noises.
    (x) is a property of vision, referring to the ability of crabs eyes to 
    enhance contrasts.
    ( ) has to do with the ability of crabs to use sonar to detect fellow horseshoe 
    crabs nearby.
    ( ) has to do with a weighting system in the crabs skeleton that allows it to 
    balance in turbulent water.

    [Explanation]
    Horseshoe crabs were essential to the discovery of lateral inhibition, a property of 
    vision present in horseshoe crabs as well as humans, that enables enhancement of 
    contrast at edges of objects as was demonstrated in class. In 1967, Haldan Hartline 
    received the Nobel prize for his research on vision and in particular his research 
    investigating lateral inhibition using horseshoe crabs.

.. _Numerical Input:

*******************
Numerical Input
*******************

In numerical input problems, students enter numbers or specific and
relatively simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. 

.. image:: ../Images/image292.png
 :alt: Image of a numerical input problem

Note that students' responses don't have to be exact for these problems. You can 
specify a margin of error, or tolerance. You can also specify a correct answer explicitly, or use a Python script. For more information, see the instructions below.

Responses for numerical input problems can include integers, fractions,
and constants such as *pi* and *g*. Responses can also include text
representing common functions, such as square root (sqrt) and log base 2
(log2), as well as trigonometric functions and their inverses, such as
sine (sin) and arcsine (arcsin). For these functions, Studio changes the
text that the student enters into mathematical symbols. The following
example shows the way Studio renders students' text responses in
numerical input problems. 

.. image:: ../Images/Math5.gif

The following are a few more examples of the way that Studio renders numerical input
text that students enter.

.. _Math Expression Syntax:

Math Expression Syntax
----------------------

In numerical input problems, the **student's input** may be more complicated than a
simple number. Expressions like ``sqrt(3)`` and even ``1+e^(sin(pi/2)+2*i)``
are valid, and evaluate to 1.73 and -0.13 + 2.47i, respectively.

A summary of the syntax follows:

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Accepted number types:

- Integers: '2520'
- Normal floats: '3.14'
- With no integer part: '.98'
- Scientific notation: '1.2e-2' (=0.012)
- More s.n.: '-4.4e+5' = '-4.4e5' (=-440,000)
- Appending SI suffixes: '2.25k' (=2,250). The full list:

  ====== ========== ===============
  Suffix Stands for One of these is
  ====== ========== ===============
  %      percent    0.01 = 1e-2
  k      kilo       1000 = 1e3
  M      mega       1e6
  G      giga       1e9
  T      tera       1e12
  c      centi      0.01 = 1e-2
  m      milli      0.001 = 1e-3
  u      micro      1e-6
  n      nano       1e-9
  p      pico       1e-12
  ====== ========== ===============

The largest possible number handled currently is exactly the largest float
possible (in the Python language). This number is 1.7977e+308. Any expression
containing larger values will not evaluate correctly, so it's best to avoid
this situation.

Default Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple and commonly used mathematical/scientific constants are included by
default. These include:

- ``i`` and ``j`` as ``sqrt(-1)``
- ``e`` as Euler's number (2.718...)
- ``pi``
- ``k``: the Boltzmann constant (~1.38e-23 in Joules/Kelvin)
- ``c``: the speed of light in m/s (2.998e8)
- ``T``: the positive difference between 0K and 0°C (285.15)
- ``q``: the fundamental charge (~1.602e-19 Coloumbs)

Operators and Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The normal operators apply (with normal order of operations):
``+ - * / ^``. Also provided is a special "parallel resistors" operator given
by ``||``. For example, an input of ``1 || 2`` would represent the resistance
of a pair of parallel resistors (of resistance 1 and 2 ohms), evaluating to 2/3
(ohms).

At the time of writing, factorials written in the form '3!' are invalid, but
there is a workaround. Students can specify ``fact(3)`` or ``factorial(3)`` to
access the factorial function.

The default included functions are the following:

- Trig functions: sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot
- Their inverses: arcsin, arccos, arctan, arcsec, arccsc, arccot
- Other common functions: sqrt, log10, log2, ln, exp, abs
- Factorial: ``fact(3)`` or ``factorial(3)`` are valid. However, you must take
  care to only input integers. For example, ``fact(1.5)`` would fail.
- Hyperbolic trig functions and their inverses: sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, csch,
  coth, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh, arcsech, arccsch, arccoth


=================================
Create a Numerical Input Problem 
=================================

You can create numerical problems in the Simple Editor and in the Advanced Editor regardless of the answer to the problem. If the text of your problem doesn't include any italics, bold formatting, or special characters, you can create the problem in the Simple Editor. If the text of your problem contains special formatting or characters, or if your problem contains a Python script, you'll use the Advanced Editor.

For example, the following example problems require the Advanced Editor.

    :alt: Image of the numerical input button
   
   When you do this, an equal sign appears next to the answer.
        
#. (Optional) Specify a margin of error, or tolerance. You can specify a percentage, number, or range.

   * To specify a percentage on either side of the correct answer, add **+-NUMBER%** after the answer. For example, if you want to include a 2% tolerance, add **+-2%**. 

   * To specify a number on either side of the correct answer, add **+-NUMBER** after the answer. For example, if you want to include a tolerance of 5, add **+-5**.

   * To specify a range, use brackets [] or parentheses (). A bracket indicates that range includes the number next to it. A parenthesis indicates that the range does not include the number next to it. For example, if you specify **[5, 8)**, correct answers can be 5, 6, and 7, but not 8. Likewise, if you specify **(5, 8]**, correct answers can be 6, 7, and 8, but not 5.

Text Input
*******************

In text input problems, students enter text into a response field. The
response can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as
punctuation marks. Because the text that the student enters must match
the instructor's specified answer exactly, including spelling and
punctuation, we recommend that you specify more than one attempt for
text input problems to allow for typographical errors.

You can create multiple choice problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced Editor.

Simple Editor
-------------

To create a text input problem in the Simple Editor, follow these steps.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click **Problem**.
#. In the **Select Problem Component Type** screen, click **Text Input**
   on the **Common Problem Types** tab.
#. In the new Problem component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. Replace the default text with the text for your problem.
#. Determine the text of the problem to use as a label, and then surround that text with two sets of angle brackets (>><<).
#. Select the text of the answer, and then click the text input button.

For the example problem above, the text in the Problem component is the
following.

::

    >>What is the technical term that refers to the fact that, when enough people 
    sleep under a bednet, the disease may altogether disappear?<<
    = herd immunity

    [explanation]
    The correct answer is herd immunity. As more and more people use bednets, 
    the risk of malaria begins to fall for everyone – users and non-users alike. 
    This can fall to such a low probability that malaria is effectively eradicated 
    from the group (even when the group does not have 100% bednet coverage).

                  In contact immunity, a vaccinated individual passes along his immunity to another person through contact with feces or bodily fluids. The answer to the question above refers to the form of immunity that occurs when so many members of a population are protected, an infectious disease is unlikely to spread to the unprotected population.

                  Although a firewall provides protection for a population, the term "firewall" is used more in computing and technology than in epidemiology.

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>herd immunity</b>. As more and more people use bednets, the risk of malaria begins to fall for everyone – users and non-users alike. This can fall to such a low probability that malaria is effectively eradicated from the group (even when the group does not have 100% bednet coverage).</p>

Multiple Responses in Text Input Problems
=========================================

You can specify more than one correct response for text input problems. 
For example, instead of requiring students to enter exactly "Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Junior," you can allow answers of "Martin Luther King," "Doctor Martin 
Luther King," and other variations. To do this, you can use the Simple Editor or the Advanced Editor.

Simple Editor
-------------

To specify additional correct responses in the Simple Editor, include "or=" (without the quotation marks) before each additional correct response.

::

    >>What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?<<
    = Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
    or= Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior
    or= Martin Luther King, Jr.
    or= Martin Luther King



Advanced Editor
---------------

To specify additional correct responses in the Advanced Editor, add an ``<additional_answer>``  for each correct response inside the opening and closing ``<stringresponse>`` tags.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>

  <p>What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?</p>
    
  <stringresponse answer="Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr." type="ci" >
    <additional_answer>Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior</additional_answer>
    <additional_answer>Martin Luther King, Jr.</additional_answer>
    <additional_answer>Martin Luther King</additional_answer>
    <textline label="What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?" size="20"/>
  </stringresponse>

  </problem>


=========================================
Case Sensitivity and Text Input Problems
=========================================

By default, text input problems do not require a case sensitive response. You can change this
and require a case sensitive answer.

To make a text input response case sensitive, you must use :ref:`Advanced Editor`.

In the Advanced Editor, you see that the **type** attribute of the **stringresponse** 
element equals **ci**, for *case insensitive*. For example:

::

    <stringresponse answer="Michigan" type="ci">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>

To make the response case sensitive, change the value of the **type** attribute to **cs**.

::

    <stringresponse answer="Michigan" type="cs">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>
    
=============================================
Response Field Length of Text Input Problems
=============================================

By default, the response field for text input problems is 20 characters long. 

You should preview the unit to ensure that the length of the response input field
accommodates the correct answer, and provides extra space for possible incorrect answers.

If the default response field length is not sufficient, you can change it using :ref:`Advanced Editor`.

In the advanced editor, in the XML block for the answer, you see that the **size** attribute of the **textline** element equals **20**:

::

    <stringresponse answer="Democratic Republic of the Congo" type="ci">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>

To change the response field length, change the value of the **size** attribute:

::

    <stringresponse answer="Democratic Republic of the Congo" type="ci">
      <textline size="40"/>
    </stringresponse>

====================================================
Hints and Regular Expressions in Text Input Problems
====================================================

You can provide hints that appear when students enter common incorrect answers in text input problems. You can also set a text input problem to allow a regular expression as an answer. To do this, you'll have to modify the problem's XML in the Advanced Editor. 

The regular expression that the student enters must contain the part of the answer that the instructor specifies. For example, if an instructor has specified  ``<answer=".*example answer.*" type="regexp">``, correct answers include ``example answered``, ``two example answers``, or even ``==example answer==``, but not ``examples`` or ``example anser``.

You can add ``regexp`` to the value of the ``type`` attribute, for example: ``type="ci regexp"`` or ``type="regexp"`` or ``type="regexp cs"``. In this case, any answer or hint are treated as regular expressions.
